# Attempt to understand How YikYak was made
**My story behind trying to re-create YikYk**

> I have re-created parts of the famous mobile app was known as YikYak in C#. For a while I was obsessed with the idea of being anonymous. I was an active user of the platform at the time. Soon the app was being abused and misused by various types of people and for various reasons. After the app was forced to take down from both Apple and PlayStore. I begin to research on the [The RISE and FALL of YikYak](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/27/style/yik-yak-bullying-mary-washington.html), sometimes later I had realized the potental threat and danger the anonymity posed to it's users and community. I spent quite some times researching about some app and how to come up with a way to right all the wrongs.

**Further Plans**
> Due to final year of my Software Engineering, I had to put the project on hold. I have plans to add multi user functionalities, region control, moderators console and an android app. I have already started the development of the android app however that is also on hold.

## YikYak -> Mumble
**Why did I choose the name Mumble?**
> Due to copyright reason at that time and YikYak being a hot news on the market, I had to name it something else.

## Installation

Download [Visual Studio Community 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) and simply open either of the projects.

## Design & Implementation

In the document folder find the mumble.pdf file. This file will show the entire UML process and help you understand how YikYak works.

The project was first created in Console then later I had decided to give it a GUI.

1. MumbleAppCSharp > Console
> Console app, navigations are limited, heavy background process.
2. MumbleAppCSharp > GUI
> GUI app, does not function yet.
